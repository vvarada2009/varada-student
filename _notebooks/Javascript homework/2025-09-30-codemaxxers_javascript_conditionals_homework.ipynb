Conditionals are basically decision-making tools in programming that let the computer choose between different actions based on certain criteria. Real-life examples include checking whether a phone battery is low before sending a notification, or deciding whether someone can drive based on their age and license status. In JavaScript, conditionals require curly braces {} and explicit comparison operators like ===, whereas in Python, indentation determines the block and == is used for equality."

One change I made was in Hack 3, where I modified the VIP message to say \"VIP Entrance — Welcome\" to show a personal edit. I would like the lesson to include more examples of combining multiple conditions with && and || so I can better understand how to simplify complex nested logic.\n"
