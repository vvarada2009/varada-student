## Overview

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how the **frontend** and **backend** of a website work together to retrieve, display, and interact with data. This is the foundation of **full-stack development**.

By the end, you will:
- Understand how frontends request data from a backend
- Build a basic API route to send and receive data
- Connect your JavaScript frontend to Flask or Spring backend
- Display live data on a webpage

---

## What Is Full Stack?

A **full stack** app includes:
- **Frontend**: What users see (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Logic and data management (Flask or Spring)
- **Database**: Where the data lives (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)

These parts communicate using **HTTP requests** (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) via **APIs**.

---

## Step 1: Create a Data Endpoint

Use your backend (Flask or Spring) to expose data through an API.

### Flask Example (`/api/data`):
```python
@app.route('/api/data')
def get_data():
    return jsonify({"name": "Alex", "score": 42})
```

### Spring Example:
```java
@RestController
public class DataController {
  @GetMapping("/api/data")
  public Map<String, Object> getData() {
    return Map.of("name", "Alex", "score", 42);
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Fetch Data with JavaScript
In your HTML file, add a `<script>` tag to retrieve and display the data:
```html
<script>
  fetch('/api/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      document.getElementById('output').textContent = 
        `Name: ${data.name}, Score: ${data.score}`;
    });
</script>

<div id="output"></div>
```

## Step 3: Run and View Locally

- Make sure your backend server is running
- Open your HTML page in the browser
- You should see live data populated from the backend

> This is full-stack in action: data retrieved by the backend is shown through the frontend.

## Step 4: Build On It

Now that you're retrieving data:
- Build a form that saves data to the backend
- Add a leaderboard or profile dashboard
- Use buttons or dropdowns to query and filter data
- Secure routes using authentication later on

## Step 5: Deployment Tips

When deploying:

- Host your frontend and backend together (or connect across domains)
- Make sure API URLs are correct (e.g., `/api/data`)
- Test both local and production behavior with tools like Postman

## Summary

Data retrieval is the bridge between user interfaces and databases.

You now know how to:

- Build backend API routes
- Connect your frontend using fetch()
- Display data dynamically on your site
