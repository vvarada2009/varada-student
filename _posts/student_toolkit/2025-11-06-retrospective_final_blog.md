# 💻 My Computer Science Journey 🌱

---

## 🚀 1. Comparing Myself to the Beginning of the Year

When I first joined this class, I walked in with **zero coding experience**.  
I had only heard of programming languages like **Python** and **JavaScript**, but I didn’t know what they actually *did* or how they worked. 

At the start, I struggled with the basics such as cloning repositories, getting vscode to work on my device, commiting changes, and more. 

But as the trimester went by, I became much more confident with the tools we use every day. I learned how to:
- 💻 Use the **VS Code **
- 📁 Organize files and repositories
- 🔄 **Clone, fork, and push commits** to GitHub
- 🚀 **Deploy** projects online 



Along the way, I also discovered the importance **collaboration**. During our **Digital Famine Project**, I started interacting more with classmates, asking for help when I got stuck, and sharing ideas to help others too. Through this, I had an opportunity to improve my teamwork skills.

The person I was at the beginning of the year would have been shocked to see me creating games and more today!

## 🧩 2. Remembering Key Things from the Three Sprints

| **Sprint** | **Learnings & Challenges** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **🌀 Sprint 1:** | Sprint 1 was easily the most frustrating — but also the most important — part of my learning journey. I struggled just trying to get **VS Code** to work. First, I worked on my **school laptop**, but it was slow and I had a lot of trouble getting thigs to load and run effectively. Then I switched to my **MacBook**, which turned out to be too old for virtual environments or `make`. Finally, after endless trial and error, I set everything up successfully on my **Windows PC**. That moment taught me something huge: **coding requires patience and persistence**. I had to work through challenges and it taught me to nevel give up. It was really satisfying when I finally made my first commit after weeks of not being able to get vscode to run properly. By the end of Sprint 1, I learned how to troubleshoot problems on my own and felt more resilient than ever. |
| **💡 Sprint 2:** Building Foundations | This sprint helped me actually understand how coding *works*. We dove deeper into **Python** and **JavaScript**, reinforcing essential topics like **strings**, **loops**, **booleans**, and **conditionals**. Each exercise made the concepts clearer, and I began to learn patterns between the two languages. Our lessons and peer-assigned activities gave me more confidence to write my own code. We also worked on **presentations**, and even though my group missed the interactive part of the lesson, I learned how to organize information, speak confidently, and learn to make lessons engaging through feedback — skills that later helped me during **Night at the Museum**. |
| **🌍 Sprint 3:** Collaboration and Creation | Sprint 3 was when everything came together. We collaborated on the **Digital Famine Project**, which meant working not only within small groups but also across the entire class. We managed tasks through **shared repositories** and balancing ideas from multiple people. I worked on **Submodule 1: Awareness**, as part of the **Media Literacy Plant**. Initially, our plan was to create a video, and I was responsible for brainstorming, scripting, and planning visuals. Later, we switched to make an **interactive game** — something more hands-on for the audience. My original ideas from the script turned into the foundation of the game. The game taught users to sort media into three “buckets”: **Sell**, **Inform**, and **Persuade**. Furthermore, besides working on the core idea and helping create the game for submodule 1, I helped with the **vault code** system. I helped to ensure the background for the vault was the same as the others, the code worked and lead to a certificate for completeting the media literacy module, and formatting everything so it matched a overall theme. Through this sprint, I improved my **teamwork**, **creativity**, and **attention to detail** and learn how to transform a collaborative idea into a tangible product.

## 🎨 3. Night at the Museum Experience

**Night at the Museum** was the first time I got to **showcase** all our hard work and creativity in front of students, parents, and teachers. I had a really great experience connnecting with students form other computer science classes like CSSE and CSA. Seeing people play our game, solve vault puzzles, and compete with their friends on who would win the game first was very exciting. Furthermore, it was really great talking to parent and explaining our project to them and even answering some technical questions. I was able to incorporate skills from sprint 2 about presenting and implement them while presenting at N@TM by speaking clearly and having peers play our games as we showed them the modules of our media literacy planet. 

**💬 Feedback that stood out to me:**
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Parents loved how **interactive**, **organized**, and **educational** our project was.  
- 🎮 Students from CSSE said the awareness game was fun and reminded them of topics such as propaganda which they learnt in their history or english classes at school
- 🌟 Many people commented on how polished our vault design looked, especially the code and visuals at the end.  

Overall, this night was very fun and engaging. It was a great experience to meet different people and present our idea and work to them.

## 🧠 4. What I Want to Learn Next in Computer Science

As I look ahead, I want to dive into **projects that have real-world applications**.  
Since I’m very interested in **healthcare and neuroscience**, I’d love to design a tool or application that could help people. 

In future projects, I also want to become more organized. I want to use **GitHub Issues** more effectively and set up a detailed **Kanban board** to manage tasks and deadlines. I’ve realized how powerful planning tools can be in keeping teams productive and focused.  

Beyond that, I want to explore how **computer science connects with the technologies we rely on daily** — like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data analytics. Understanding how code powers everything around us will help me grow and learn things which I am highly interested in.

## 📝 5. 2018 Multiple Choice Review

**🧭 My Approach:**  
When I took the 2018 multiple-choice test, I didn’t set a timer. Instead, I focused on answering questions which I could and noting down topics which I struggles with.  I first answered the questions I was confident about and used logic to work through the ones I wasn’t sure of. For tougher questions, I wrote the **topic name** and **question number** on a sticky note beside me and guessed on the question and moved on.

Once I finished the test, I went back, reviewed my guesses, and analyzed the questions I missed. I noticed patterns in my mistakes — certain topics kept reappearing — so I researched those areas and revisited the **College Board-recommended lessons** to strengthen my weak spots.  

**📊 My Score:** 46 / 66  

Questions that I missed: 
9,14,20, 21, 22,24,25,26,30,31,33,38,42,45,48,50,55,57,61,62

Question name I missed:
-Benefits of incremental and iterative development
-Comparing loop algorithms
-Finding the maximum value of three suing MAX
-Comparing robot algorithms
-Procedure to determine the weather
-Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters
-Shortening strings by replacing TH and IS
-Completing robot code by adding if statement
-Video-streaming service by genre
-Comparing loop algorithms with robots
-Apartment rental Web Site flowchart
-Frequent customers of a snack bar
-Increasing bit representation for internet protocol
-NAND logic gate
-Science experiment with 75 percent successful trials
-Searchning list target
-Results of the Keep Playing Procedure
-Generate Happy from Harp and Puppy
-Data about students at East and West High Schools
-Comparing online encyclopedia with paper encyclopedia

MC Corrections: 
9) My answer: C
Correct answer: D
Why: Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.
14) My answer: B
Correct answer: C
Why: The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
20: My answer: C
Correct answer: A
Why: The expression will first determine the maximum of a and b and then determine the maximum of the resulting value and c. This will result in the maximum of all three values.
21:  My answer: C
Correct answer: B
Why: The code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square.
