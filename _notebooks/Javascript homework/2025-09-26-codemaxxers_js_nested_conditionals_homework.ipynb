        "\n",
        "Answers: \n",
        "1) The most challenging problem was Problem 3 (Smart Thermostat) because it had multiple factors to consider at once — occupancy, time of day, temperature thresholds, and energy-saving mode — which made it tricky to structure the nested conditionals correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) I decided to structure the nested conditionals top-down, first checking if someone is home, then the time of day, and finally the temperature thresholds. For when no one is home, I nested the energy-saving mode check and then handled temperature adjustments, which made the logic clear and easy to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) A real-world situation that could require even more levels of nesting is a hospital patient monitoring system, which might need to consider heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, medication schedules, and emergency alerts all together to determine the proper response.\n"
