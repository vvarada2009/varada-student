## Overview

Welcome! Today we will personalize your GitHub Pages **About Me** site. This is an important step to create a space that represents *you* and your journey as a developer.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Edit your **About Me** page using Markdown  
- Add images to your site  
- Test your site locally and deploy it to GitHub Pages  

Let‚Äôs get started!

## Step 1: Edit Your `about.md` File

1. Open your project folder in VSCode.  
2. Navigate to the `navigation/` folder and open `about.md`.  
3. Replace the placeholder content with information about yourself ‚Äî your interests, courses, and links. Here‚Äôs an example snippet:

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: "About Me"
permalink: /about/

## Step 2: Add Images to Your About Page

Images make your page more engaging and personal! Here‚Äôs how you can add images correctly.

### Find and Save Your Image

- Search for an image online that represents you or your interests (e.g., a state flag, favorite animal, or personal photo).  
- Right-click the image and select **Save Image As...**  
- Save it with a clear name like `default.png` or `profile_pic.png`.

### Organize Your Image Files

- Move or copy your downloaded image into the `images` folder.

Your project should look like this:
![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/imagesdir.png)

### Link Images in Markdown with `{% raw %}{{ site.baseurl }}{% endraw %}`

Use this syntax in your Markdown to ensure images work:

{% raw %}
`{{ site.baseurl }}/images/default.png`
{% endraw %}

Take some time to try this yourself.

By now, you should have personalized your About Me page with your own interests and added at least one image that represents you.

## Step 3: Test Your Site Locally

Before pushing your changes to GitHub, it‚Äôs a good idea to preview your site on your computer.

1. Open your terminal in VSCode
2. Run the command:  
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. This will build your site and start a local server (http://127.0.0.1:4600/student/)

4. Open your browser and go to that address to see your site with your latest changes.

## Step 4: Commit & Sync Your Changes to GitHub

Once you‚Äôre happy with how your site looks locally, push your changes so everyone can see them online.

### In VSCode:

1. Click on the **Source Control** tab (the icon with the branch or üîÉ).  
2. Stage all your changes (click the "+" next to changed files or use **Stage All**).  
3. Write a clear commit message like: **Personalize About Me page**
4. Click the ‚úîÔ∏è **Commit** button.  
5. Click the **Sync Changes** button to push your commit to GitHub.

Once synced, your updated About Me page will be live on your GitHub Pages site!
