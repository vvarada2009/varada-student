## Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

When creating accounts for this course, it's important to understand what Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is and how to protect it. PII refers to any information that can be used to identify you.

In this course, there may be instances where you are asked to share PII. We encourage you to share it thoughtfully and in ways that align with your personal and professional goals.

### Why PII Matters

Websites like `LinkedIn` are platforms where we showcase our accomplishments and intentionally share certain aspects of our PII to build a professional presence.

As individuals and as a society, we often share PII on platforms like TikTok, Reddit, X, Instagram, or Facebook. This sharing can provide a sense of satisfaction, sometimes referred to as the "dopamine effect." While we may feel proud of the accomplishments we share, there are instances where we or others might regret sharing certain information, such as lighthearted accounts of social activities.

It is important to recognize that all the accounts mentioned above contribute to your PII and become part of your digital footprint.

### Types of PII

* **Public Information**: These are details that are generally known and shared:
  * Name
  * Email (consider using a secondary email for public use)
  * Picture
  * High School and College attended
  * State and City of residence
  * Properties you own

* **Sensitive Information**: Be more cautious with these details:
  * Full birth date
  * Place of Birth
  * Street Address
  * Phone Number
  * Maiden names of Mother or Grandmother
  * Driver's License Number
  * Home router location
  * Previous residences
  * Credit Reports

* **Highly Confidential Information**: Keep these absolutely secret:
  * Internet Access Credentials (e.g., Wi-Fi passwords)
  * Google key store (used for app signing or sensitive data storage)
  * Two-Factor Authentication sources (e.g., backup codes)
  * Social Security Number

### Techniques to Increase Security

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use systems that require a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, email, or an authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator).
* **Biometrics**: Secure your devices with fingerprints, facial recognition, or other biometric methods to add an extra layer of security.
* **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Learn about public-key cryptography, which uses a pair of keys (one public, one private) to encrypt and decrypt messages. This technology is commonly used in SSL/TLS for secure websites (e.g., `https://`).
* **Strong Passwords**: Use complex and unique passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager (e.g., LastPass, 1Password) to securely store and manage them.
* **Regular Software Updates**: Keep your operating system, applications, and antivirus software up to date to protect against the latest security vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Home Router**: Set a strong password for your home router and change the default admin credentials to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Secure Wi-Fi**: Use strong passwords for your home Wi-Fi network to prevent unauthorized access. When using public Wi-Fi (e.g., at coffee shops), consider using a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic.
* **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data on your devices and backups to protect it from unauthorized access. Tools like BitLocker (Windows) or FileVault (Mac) can help.

### Be Aware of Internet Threats

* **Viruses and Malware**: These malicious programs compromise security and can be spread through email attachments, infected websites, or downloads. Use antivirus software and avoid opening suspicious files or links.
* **Phishing**: Be cautious of deceptive emails or websites designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the sender's identity and avoid clicking on suspicious links.
* **Social Engineering**: Be aware of tactics used to manipulate you into divulging confidential information, such as impersonation or urgent requests. Stay vigilant and verify requests before sharing sensitive data.
* **Post-Incident Actions**: If your information is compromised, take immediate steps to secure your accounts:
  * Change passwords for affected accounts.
  * Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
  * Monitor your accounts for unusual activity.
  * Revise and update your PII strategy to prevent future incidents.

By understanding and protecting your PII, you can safely navigate the digital world and keep sensitive and highly confidential personal information secure.

## Open Coding Society Accounts

As part of this course, you will need to create several accounts to participate in coding activities, collaborate with peers, and showcase your work. These accounts will require you to share some level of Personal Identifiable Information (PII). By applying the strategies discussed earlier, you can create and manage these accounts in a way that protects your privacy while enabling you to build a professional digital presence.

### Email Accounts

You will be using and sharing email accounts with the teacher and fellow students.

A strategy I employ is maintaining different email accounts according to the expected type or volume of information (junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This is not about security, but it helps set an expectation for the "purpose," "value," or "importance" of information aggregated to that endpoint.

### GitHub Account

We want you to create a GitHub account. You will need to establish a GitHub user ID, username, and email. This can include one or more email accounts. We will ask that you make a name and email public. This account will be your social media account as a coder.

We suggest that you use a "common" email account for this platform. Don’t use your school email; GitHub will be with you long after you graduate from high school.

The email you make public should be in the same category as what you would share on more professional social media accounts, i.e., in the "common" email category.

**Examples of Professional User IDs**:

* **Good**:
  * `john-doe`: Simple, professional, and easy to remember.
  * `johndev`: Highlights your identity as a developer.
  * `jdoe123`: A clean and professional option if your preferred username is already taken.

* **Bad**:
  * `coolguy123`: Unprofessional and does not reflect your identity as a coder.
  * `john.doe2005`: Includes unnecessary personal information (e.g., birth year), which could compromise your privacy. The dot could be a problem on some platforms, stick to dash.  
  * `ilovecodinglol`: Informal and not suitable for professional platforms.

### GitHub Pages

We will ask you to publish a Student Portfolio using GitHub Pages. This will be a public website and will be indexed by Google and Google Analytics.

### Slack Account

We will ask you to create an account on Slack, which will require PII. We suggest that you use a "common" email account for this platform. We recommend that you don't use your school email.

PII in this category should be restricted to the teacher and fellow students. This includes students from the past, as we have allowed this to be open to those who were formerly enrolled. There are different Slack workspaces for CSSE, CSP, and CSA.

### Portfolio Account

We will ask you to create a user account based on your GitHub user ID. This will be used to build course lists, provide compute services (e.g., AWS, KASM), and aggregate analytics to your instructor.

## PII Strategy on Account Creation

As you navigate this course and the digital world, it is essential to establish and continually refine your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) strategy. You are likely already sharing some PII, but it’s important to evaluate what information is appropriate to share and how to protect it. By proactively managing your PII, you can safeguard your privacy while building a professional digital presence.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Categorize Information**:
   * **Public Information**: Information you are comfortable sharing publicly, such as your name and general interests.
   * **Sensitive Information**: Information that should be shared cautiously, such as your full birth date and phone number.
   * **Highly Confidential Information**: Information that should be kept strictly private, such as your social security number and internet access credentials.

2. **Use Different Email Accounts**:
   * Maintain different email accounts for different purposes (e.g., junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This helps manage the type and volume of information you receive and sets expectations for the importance of the information.

3. **Be Prepared for Security Incidents**:
   * Anticipate potential security breaches and take proactive steps to secure your accounts. Regularly update your passwords, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and monitor your accounts for unusual activity.

4. **Adapt and Evolve**:
   * As your digital footprint grows, continually reassess and adapt your PII strategy. Stay informed about the latest security practices and tools to ensure your strategy remains effective.

## Hacks

Create your course accounts.

As you create and manage your accounts, always be mindful of the information you are sharing. Protecting your PII is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and adaptability. By categorizing your information, using different email accounts, and preparing for potential security incidents, you can better safeguard your personal information.
