    "\n",
    "Now that you have the game running, let's talk about the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for anything to show up on your screen in the first place, we have to create a `canvas` for everything to be drawn on. The `canvas` is defined in `HTML`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<canvas id=\"world\"></canvas>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the game needs to connect to the Document Object Model (DOM) element for the canvas.  We have named the HTML element's id `world`, and we will define a `GameWorld` class to manage the `canvas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to need to **declare variables** inside the GameWorld class using the keyword `this`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "this.canvas = document.getElementById(\"world\");\n",
    "// document.getElementById(\"world\") finds the <canvas id=\"world\"> element in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "this.ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n",
    "// every canvas has a drawing context. for example, getContext('2d') returns the 2D drawing API (methods like drawImage, fillRect, clearRect).\n",
    "// canvas is the DOM element; ctx is what draws pixels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sizing the Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "Toward the bottom of the JavaScript `<script>` tag, just before the closing `</script>` tag, you will find the `GameWorld` class. We have defined this code to manage everything that writes to the canvas, aka game world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to setup the `GameWorld`\n",
    "- The `canvas` is setup to match window screen.  Look at all the `this.canvas` commands.\n",
    "- The `ctx` is used to draw into the canvas\n",
    "- The `game objects` are assigned to the `this.gameObjects` array. These game pieces are inserted into the GameWorld.\n",
    "- In object oriented programming language...\n",
    "  - The `GameWorld` has-a `Background`\n",
    "  - The `GameWorld` has-a `Player`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "class GameWorld {\n",
    "  static gameSpeed = 5;\n",
    "  constructor(backgroundImg, spriteImg) {\n",

    "    this.canvas.style.position = 'absolute';\n",
    "    this.canvas.style.left = `0px`;\n",
    "    this.canvas.style.top = `${(window.innerHeight - this.height) / 2}px`;\n",

    "      new Background(backgroundImg, this),\n",
    "      new Player(spriteImg, this)\n",
    "    ];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of definitions that could be commented in the above code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "`canvas.width`, `canvas.height`: set the drawing buffer size (pixel resolution of the canvas).\n",
    "\n",
    "`canvas.style.width`, `canvas.style.height`: set the **CSS** size (how big it appears on screen).\n",
    "They set both equal so the drawing area matches the visible size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In our game, everything that appears on the screen (like the alien planet background or the UFO sprite) can be thought of as a **game object**.\n",
    "Instead of writing separate code for each image, we create a **class** that acts like a blueprint.  This blueprint is defined in the `class GameObject`\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "class GameObject {\n",
    "  constructor(image, width, height, x = 0, y = 0, speedRatio = 0) {\n",
    "    this.image = image;       // what picture to draw\n",
    "    this.width = width;       // how wide to draw it\n",
    "    this.height = height;     // how tall to draw it\n",
    "    this.x = x;               // where it is horizontally\n",
    "    this.y = y;               // where it is vertically\n",
    "    this.speedRatio = speedRatio;\n",
    "    this.speed = gameSpeed * this.speedRatio; // how fast it moves\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  update() {\n",
    "    // gets filled in by subclasses (like Background)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  draw(ctx) {\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of hardcoding the background or sprite separately, we can now make them instances of the `GameObject` class. Look for the `Background` and `Player` classes in the `<script>` code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `Background` and `Player` classes use the keyword extends in their definition, they `inherit` the properties of `GameObject`. Inheritance is a key to OOP programming and using OOP language we say.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Background` is-a `GameObject`\n",
    "- The `Player` is-a `GameObject`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Our background is a special game object: it has to **move sideways** forever to look like the player is moving. To make it seamless, we draw **two copies** of the background image side-by-side. As one scrolls off the screen, the other one takes its place.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` js\n",
    "class Background extends GameObject {\n",
    "  constructor(image, gameWorld) {\n",
    "    // Fill entire canvas\n",
    "    super(image, gameWorld.width, gameWorld.height, 0, 0, 0.1);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  update() {\n",
    "    this.x = (this.x - this.speed) % this.width;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  draw(ctx) {\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x + this.width, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard part of `Background` is it uses a `super` call to `GameObject` to define it's `this` attributes like this.x, this.y, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special part is that it `overrides` or customizes the `update()` and `draw()` methods for its unique behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update()` moves the background a little bit every frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The % this.width (modulo) makes sure it “wraps around” so the background never disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "`draw()` paints two backgrounds so there’s no empty gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Game Loop (Animation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of a game is the `gameLoop` that keeps running continuously. This is where things get updated and redrawn, frame after frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "gameLoop() {\n",
    "  this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "  for (const obj of this.objects) {\n",
    "    obj.update();\n",
    "    obj.draw(this.ctx);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  requestAnimationFrame(this.gameLoop.bind(this));\n",
    "}\n",
    "start() {\n",
    "  this.gameLoop();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`clearRect` wipes the screen so old frames so they don’t overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` cycles through every gameObject we defined with the GameWorld constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update` typically changes object positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`draw` places the image onto the canvas according to recent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "`requestAnimationFrame` tells the browser to “do this again on the next frame.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what makes the background look alive — it’s being redrawn 60 times per second!\n",
