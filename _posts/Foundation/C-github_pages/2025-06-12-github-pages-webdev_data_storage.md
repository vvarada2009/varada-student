# What Does Full Stack Mean?

Before we get into starting our planning, what does building a full stack application entail?

When we talk about **‚Äúfull stack‚Äù** in web development, we‚Äôre referring to the **entire set of skills and technologies** needed to build a complete web application. Think of it like making a sandwich:

---

## ü•™ Front-End (The Top Slice of Bread)

* This is what users **see and interact with**.
* It includes the **buttons, forms, and visual elements**.
* Nighthawk coders use tools like **HTML**, **SASS**, and **JavaScript** to create this.

---

## ü•© Back-End (The Filling)

* This is the **logic that happens behind the scenes**.
* It handles **data processing** and the **operations of each request and response**.
* The back-end communicates with the front-end and manages things like **storing user data** or **checking for errors**.
* Nighthawk coders use the **Python language** and **Flask framework** for this layer.

---

## üçû Database (The Bottom Slice of Bread)

* This is where all the information is **stored**, such as user accounts, messages, or product details.
* Databases help **organize and track data**.
* Nighthawk coders use **SQLAlchemy** and **SQLite** to build and manage the database.

---

## üì¶ Deployment and DevOps (Putting the Sandwich in a Bag)

* Once your sandwich (web app) is ready, you need to **put it in a bag (deploy it)** so people can enjoy it.
* This involves **setting up servers**, ensuring the app runs smoothly, and **updating it as needed**.
* The **Deployment** tab in the navigation bar will help with back-end deployment.
* For front-end deployment, check out **Tools and Equipment** and **GitHub**.

 So, building a full stack application means creating all parts of the ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù so that it‚Äôs tasty and functional from top to bottom. You design the **user interface**, handle the **logic and data storage**, and make sure everything **works together smoothly**.

After signing up to create an account, you can login. When you log in, you‚Äôll be connected to both the Java (Spring) and Python (Flask) parts of the site.

# üå± Spring (Java)

## ‚úÖ Model

* Represents **data** and **business logic**
* Typically Java classes (entities) mapped to DB tables using annotations like `@Entity`
* Contains fields, getters/setters

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String username;
    private String email;

    // getters and setters
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ API

* Defines HTTP endpoints using **controllers**
* Uses annotations like `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        // return list of users
    }

    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // create and return user
    }
}
```

---

# üêç Flask (Python)

## ‚úÖ Model

* Python class mapped to DB table (usually using SQLAlchemy)

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
```

---

## ‚úÖ API

* Defines HTTP endpoints using route decorators

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_all_users():
    return jsonify([])

@app.route('/api/users', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    return jsonify(data), 201
```

# üîë Comparison

| Concept       | Spring (Java)                             | Flask (Python)                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Model**     | Java class + JPA annotations (`@Entity`)  | Python class + SQLAlchemy fields |
| **API**       | `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping` etc. | `@app.route` decorators          |
| **ORM**       | Hibernate / JPA                           | SQLAlchemy                       |
| **Structure** | Layered (controller, service, repo)       | Minimal, flexible                |
