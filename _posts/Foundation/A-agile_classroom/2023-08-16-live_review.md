## Live Review

A Live Review is an opportunity for students to present their progress to the teacher. This is an iterative process, meaning there is no extended time provided for a Live Review.  

Work is performed daily in class, and a Live Review serves as a progress check that reflects your accomplishments at that moment in time.  

AP students are expected to average 2+ hours of homework each week.

### Types of Reviews

- **Checkpoint**: Periodic weekly or bi-weekly reviews within the Sprint.
- **Final**: A formal end-of-Sprint review summarizing Sprint objectives. This is where you, along with your pair or trio, demonstrate progress on provided assignments and hacks.

## Showcase Requirements

The Showcase is a time to review all requirements for the Sprint:

- Review Sprint Posts.
- Review Sprint Illustration.
- Review any Issues or Timelines.

During the Sprint, there are opportunities to preview, communicate, or check off burndown progress with the teacher. If you have shared progress during a Checkpoint, ensure you capture that success for the Showcase. Do not expect the teacher to remember your workâ€”maintain burndown lists and show assets to provide evidence. The final Showcase is your chance to shine, impress, and recap your journey.

### Key Expectations

1. **Format of Showcase**:
   - Showcases are typically multi-person events. This Sprint focuses on Pair/Trio/Group Programming and collaborative work, not individual efforts.
   - Ensure your work is polished and reviewed. Preparation, review, and testing are essential before presenting to the teacher. In the tech world, quality presentations are as important as the tech itself. Avoid sharing unpolished or buggy work during a Showcase, as it reflects poorly on professionalism.

2. **Use of Blogs**:
   - Google or Microsoft Docs, Sheets, and Presentations are discouraged and will result in significant deductions. It is expected that you present materials from your personal student blog or group project. Using a blog helps develop your ability to design, organize, and code.

3. **Collaboration and Accountability**:
   - Work can be shared, but all participants should be able to discuss any aspect of the work they expect to be credited for. If you did not contribute to a topic, be honest and do not attempt to claim false accomplishments.
   - Attempts to gain credit falsely or by "coat-tailing" are strongly discouraged.

4. **Preparation and Time**:
   - Each Showcase requires preparation. Avoid asking, "What do you want to show?" during the event. This type of question should be addressed beforehand.
   - Many resources have been provided to guide your preparation. Use them effectively.

5. **Sprint Blogs**:
   - The hacks and requirements outlined in the teacher's blogs and presentations should be incorporated into the materials you present during the Showcase.
