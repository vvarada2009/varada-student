# 💻 My Trimerster 1 Computer Science Journey 🌱

---

## 🚀 1. Comparing Myself to the Beginning of the Year

When I first joined this class, I walked in with zero coding experience.
I had only heard of programming languages like Python and JavaScript, but I didn’t know what they actually did or how they worked. To me, coding felt like this mysterious world full of symbols and logic that only experts could understand.

At the beginning, even the smallest things felt like big challenges — figuring out how to clone a repository, getting VS Code to actually run properly on my device, or understanding what it meant to commit and push changes to GitHub. I remember feeling a little lost, like everyone else knew what was happening while I was still trying to understand what was going on. 

But as the trimester went by, something changed. I started to gain confidence. The same things that once felt confusing started to make sense. I began learning how to:

💻 Use VS Code to write and organize my code efficiently

📁 Manage folders and files within different repositories

🔄 Clone, fork, and push commits to GitHub 

🚀 Deploy websites and projects to make them live and shareable


Along the way, I also discovered something I didn’t expect: the importance of collaboration. During our Digital Famine Project, I worked closely with my classmates, and that experience really opened my eyes. We shared ideas, divided up tasks, helped each other, and improved on creations. I had to go and talk to different people which built my communication skills. At the beginning of the trimester I only knew 2 people in the class but as we collaborated and switched up teams I got to work with new people and start to talk to other people. 

Now, looking back, the person I was at the beginning of the year would be shocked to see what I can do today. I’ve built small games, created my own website, and gained a real understanding of how code turns ideas into reality.

## 🧩 2. Remembering Key Things from the Three Sprints

| **Sprint** | **Learnings & Challenges** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **🌀 Sprint 1:** | Sprint 1 was easily the most frustrating — but also the most important — part of my learning journey. I struggled just trying to get **VS Code** to work. First, I worked on my **school laptop**, but it was slow and I had a lot of trouble getting thigs to load and run effectively. Then I switched to my **MacBook**, which turned out to be too old for virtual environments or `make`. Finally, after endless trial and error, I set everything up successfully on my **Windows PC**. That moment taught me something huge: **coding requires patience and persistence**. I had to work through challenges and it taught me to nevel give up. It was really satisfying when I finally made my first commit after weeks of not being able to get vscode to run properly. By the end of Sprint 1, I learned how to troubleshoot problems on my own and felt more resilient than ever. |
| **💡 Sprint 2:** Building Foundations | This sprint helped me actually understand how coding *works*. We dove deeper into **Python** and **JavaScript**, reinforcing essential topics like **strings**, **loops**, **booleans**, and **conditionals**. Each exercise made the concepts clearer, and I began to learn patterns between the two languages. Our lessons and peer-assigned activities gave me more confidence to write my own code. We also worked on **presentations**, and even though my group missed the interactive part of the lesson, I learned how to organize information, speak confidently, and learn to make lessons engaging through feedback — skills that later helped me during **Night at the Museum**. |
| **🌍 Sprint 3:** Collaboration and Creation | Sprint 3 was when everything came together. We collaborated on the **Digital Famine Project**, which meant working not only within small groups but also across the entire class. We managed tasks through **shared repositories** and balancing ideas from multiple people. I worked on **Submodule 1: Awareness**, as part of the **Media Literacy Plant**. Initially, our plan was to create a video, and I was responsible for brainstorming, scripting, and planning visuals. Later, we switched to make an **interactive game** — something more hands-on for the audience. My original ideas from the script turned into the foundation of the game. The game taught users to sort media into three “buckets”: **Sell**, **Inform**, and **Persuade**. Furthermore, besides working on the core idea and helping create the game for submodule 1, I helped with the **vault code** system. I helped to ensure the background for the vault was the same as the others, the code worked and lead to a certificate for completeting the media literacy module, and formatting everything so it matched a overall theme. Through this sprint, I improved my **teamwork**, **creativity**, and **attention to detail** and learn how to transform a collaborative idea into a tangible product.

## 🎨 3. Night at the Museum Experience

**Night at the Museum** was the first time I got to **showcase** all our hard work and creativity in front of students, parents, and teachers. I had a really great experience connnecting with students form other computer science classes like CSSE and CSA. Seeing people play our game, solve vault puzzles, and compete with their friends on who would win the game first was very exciting. Furthermore, it was really great talking to parent and explaining our project to them and even answering some technical questions. I was able to incorporate skills from sprint 2 about presenting and implement them while presenting at N@TM by speaking clearly and having peers play our games as we showed them the modules of our media literacy planet. 

**💬 Feedback that stood out to me:**
- Parents liked how **interactive**, **organized**, and **educational** our project was.  
- 🎮 Students from CSSE said the awareness game was fun and reminded them of topics such as propaganda which they learnt in their history or english classes at school
- 🌟 Many people commented on how polished our vault design looked, especially the code and visuals at the end.  

Overall, this night was very fun and engaging. It was a great experience to meet different people and present our idea and work to them.

## 🧠 4. What I Want to Learn Next in Computer Science

As I look ahead, I want to dive into **projects that have real-world applications**.  
Since I’m very interested in **healthcare and neuroscience**, I’d love to design a tool or application that could help people. 

In future projects, I also want to become more organized. I want to use **GitHub Issues** more effectively and set up a detailed **Kanban board** to manage tasks and deadlines. I’ve realized how powerful planning tools can be in keeping teams productive and focused.  

Beyond that, I want to explore how **computer science connects with the technologies we rely on daily** — like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data analytics. Understanding how code powers everything around us will help me grow and learn things which I am highly interested in.

## 📝 5. 2018 Multiple Choice Review

**🧭 My Approach:**  
When I took the 2018 multiple-choice test, I didn’t set a timer. Instead, I focused on answering questions which I could and noting down topics which I struggles with.  I first answered the questions I was confident about and used logic to work through the ones I wasn’t sure of. For tougher questions, I wrote the **topic name** and **question number** on a sticky note beside me and guessed on the question and moved on.

Once I finished the test, I went back, reviewed my guesses, and analyzed the questions I missed. I noticed patterns in my mistakes — certain topics kept reappearing — so I researched those areas and revisited the **College Board-recommended lessons** to strengthen my weak spots.  

**📊 My Score:** 46 / 66  

Questions that I missed and did not know how to answer at all: 
9,14,20, 21, 22,24,25,26,30,31,33,38,42,45,48,50,55,57,61,62

Question name I missed:
-Benefits of incremental and iterative development
-Comparing loop algorithms
-Finding the maximum value of three suing MAX
-Comparing robot algorithms
-Procedure to determine the weather
-Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters
-Shortening strings by replacing TH and IS
-Completing robot code by adding if statement
-Video-streaming service by genre
-Comparing loop algorithms with robots
-Apartment rental Web Site flowchart
-Frequent customers of a snack bar
-Increasing bit representation for internet protocol
-NAND logic gate
-Science experiment with 75 percent successful trials
-Searchning list target
-Results of the Keep Playing Procedure
-Generate Happy from Harp and Puppy
-Data about students at East and West High Schools
-Comparing online encyclopedia with paper encyclopedia

MC Corrections: 
9
 My answer: C
Correct answer: D
Why: Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.


14
My answer: B
Correct answer: C
Why: The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.


20
 My answer: C
Correct answer: A
Why: The expression will first determine the maximum of a and b and then determine the maximum of the resulting value and c. This will result in the maximum of all three values.


21
  My answer: C
Correct answer: B
Why: The code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square.


22
  My answer: D
Correct answer: B
Why: The Boolean expression evaluates to true when counter (the number of temperatures greater than or equal to 90) is greater than 50% of total (the number of entries in the list).


24
 My answer: B
Correct answer: C
Why: The transformation is lossless because an encoded string can be restored to its original version. For example, Open quotation, percent, hash, underscore, hash, underscore, percent E, underscore, BEST, underscore, W, hash, H, close quotation can be restored to Open quotation, THIS, underscore, IS, underscore, THE, underscore, BEST, underscore, WISH, close quotation by replacing all instances of Open quotation, percent, close quotationwith Open quotation, T H, close quotation and by replacing all instances of Open quotation, hash, close quotation with Open quotation, I S, close quotation.


25
 My answer: C
Correct answer: B
Why:  It is not possible to use byte pair encoding in the string Open quotation, LEVEL, underscore, UP, close quotationbecause no pair of characters appears in the string more than once.


26
 My answer: C
Correct answer: A
Why: 
This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.


31
 My answer: A
Correct answer: C
Why: Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid.


33 
My answer: D
Correct answer: A
Why:  The flowchart sets include to true whenever floor is greater than 1 0 or bedrooms equal 3, and sets include to false otherwise. Therefore, the algorithm is equivalent to     Include, left arrow, open parenthesis, floor greater than 10, close parenthesis, OR, open parenthesis, bedrooms equal 3, close parenthesis.


38
 My answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Why:  The expression count, MOD, 10 equals 0 evaluates to true when count is a multiple of 1 0, and so this
code segment sets cost to 0 under the appropriate conditions.


42
 My answer: B
Correct answer: D
Why:With 32-bit addressing, IPv4 has 2 raised to the thirty second power possible addresses. With 128-bit addressing, IPv6 has 2 raised to the one hundred twenty eighth power possible addresses. Since 2 raised to the thirty second power times 2 raised to the ninety sixth power equals 2 raised to the one hundred twenty eighth power, IPv6 has 2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many possible addresses as IPv4.


45
 My answer: D
Correct answer: C
Why:The expression P AND Q evaluates to true when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to false otherwise. Therefore, the expression NOT, open parenthesis, P AND Q, close parenthesis evaluates to false when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to true otherwise.


48
My answer: C
Correct answer: D
Why: This option causes the experiment to be successful when RANDOM, open parenthesis 1 comma 100, close parenthesis produces a result from 1 to 7 5, or 75% of the time.


50
My answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Why:  The procedure implements a linear search, which sequentially compares each element of the list with the target
value. The list does not need to be sorted because the procedure checks list elements until either the target is found or it reaches the end of the list.


55
My answer: B
Correct answer: D
Why:  The expression open parenthesis, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, y, close quotation, close parenthesis, AND, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, yes, close quotation, close parenthesis, close parenthesisalways evaluates to false because it is not possible for the variable response to be equal to both Open quotation, y, close quotation and Open quotation, yes, close quotation. Therefore, the procedure will always
return false.


57
My answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Why: This expression concatenates the first two letters of Open quotation, Harp, close quotation with the last three letters of Open quotation, puppy, close quotation, resulting
in Open quotation, Happy, close quotation.


61
My answer: C
Correct answer: A
Why:  It is possible to create a single list of student names, sorted by last name. Both data formats provide the first and last names of each student.


62
My answer: A and B
Correct Answer: C and D
Why:  As any user has the ability to edit articles, there will be many opportunities for people with different perspectives to contribute. The online encyclopedia can be edited at any time, so it is easy to create or update articles as new information
becomes available.



Questions which I guessed and got correct: 1,6,13,16,23,30,35,40,43,47,58,60

What I learnt from on the questions that I guessed and got correct: 

1: The point of the question was to replace the "Missing Code". What I learnt from this was that you have to look for what logically correct. I brought down the "second" one and then ensured that it went to the "temp" one because it was a patter the blocks before followed.

6: I learnt that the Internet Engineering Task Force develops standards and protocols for Internet communication

13: In this question you have to analyze the table and find the hypothesis which was most consistent with the data. Through this question, I leanred how to analyze tables and look for patterns and matching it to a supporting hypothesis.

16: In this question I leanrt about what violated the MCA. If something is purchased and downladed through a licensed store or place it is not a violation.

23: In this question, I leanrt that the path from P to S was not connected at all and that it is impossible if there is only one possible path from one device to another.

30: In this question I learnt that that when a proecdure is before the loop and then # of times inside the loop, you have to add up these values. Therefore, the answer was 1+4= 5 hours to execute.


35: I leanrt that the Creative Commons licenses can be used by creators of digital music to specify how the samples can be used by others. I also learnt that ano-rights-reserved license allows others to freely make use of the samples.


40: From this question, I learnt how to analyze tables which have many rows and then being able to analyze the values given in the tables in order to find correct answer. Furthermore with questions which tell you to select more than 1 answer, I learnt that process of elimination is very useful in leading to the correct answer. 


43: This question was similar to a math question. I leanrt to look at a data table and simply answer questions about it. The key was to understand what the table was about. 


47: In this question I learnt that in public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key.


58: I leanrt that the Internet can provide tools, information, and knowledge to crowdsourcing participants and can lower geographic barriers to potential participants.


60: I learnt about how programmers can use abstractino to manage the complexity of a program. For example, placing repeated code with procedure calls is an example of a procedural abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.

###🌱 Something Cool to Share

The first day I came into CSP and we made our accounts on OpenCodingSociety, I was worried already. I was having trouble even setting up my account on the first day, so I thought I just sucked at coding overall even through it hadn't started. As the time went on I was facing more difficulties setting up VS code. However, after lots of efforts once everything was set up I started to understand how simple things worked such as making commits and seeing them deploy on my website. Even through this was just a small thing for other I really enjoyed this process because after weeks of struggling to even get VS code to open, I was very satisfied and happy to finally commit something! Before taking this class, I didn't really think of coding as something which was interesting to me, but after taking this class I developed a passion and high interest for it. I am inspired to create something in the future which combines coding with healthcare as both of these topics have become highly interesting to me. I also found this class very interactive and engaging since all my other classes require you to just learn things on your own and take tests, but this class alowed me to go out and collaborate with new people which was a very valuable experience. Overall, trimester 1 has been a great learning opportunity and growth experience for me and I look forward to the upcoming trimester as well!
