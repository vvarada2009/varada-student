# Linux and Cybersecurity Basics

Welcome to your first comprehensive lesson on **Linux fundamentals and cybersecurity awareness**! This module introduces you to working in a Linux environment, understanding essential terminal commands, managing file systems and permissions, and recognizing common security vulnerabilities that occur in real-world deployments.

---

## Linux Navigation and Command Line Skills

### Navigating the Filesystem

Understanding the file system hierarchy in Linux is crucial. Some of the most common directories include:

* `/home` – user directories
* `/etc` – system configuration files
* `/var` – logs and variable data
* `/bin` and `/usr/bin` – essential system commands

Essential navigation commands:

* `pwd` – Display the current directory
* `ls` – List files and directories
* `cd` – Change directory

> **Try it:**
>
> ```bash
> pwd
> ls
> cd /etc
> pwd
> ls
> cd
> pwd
> ```

### Creating and Modifying Files

Creating and editing files from the command line is a daily skill in Linux.

* `touch filename` – Create a new empty file
* `nano filename` – Open a file in a text editor within the terminal
* `cat filename` – Display file contents

> **Try it:**
>
> ```bash
> touch welcome.txt
> nano welcome.txt
> cat welcome.txt
> ```

You can also redirect output into files:

```bash
echo "Hello, Linux" > message.txt
```

### Permissions and Superuser Access

Linux permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file. Each file has three permission sets:

* **Owner**
* **Group**
* **Others**

Permission symbols:

* `r` = read
* `w` = write
* `x` = execute

Key commands:

* `chmod` – Change permissions
* `chown` – Change file ownership
* `sudo` – Execute commands as a superuser

> **Try it:**
>
> ```bash
> ls -l welcome.txt
> chmod 755 welcome.txt
> ls -l welcome.txt
> sudo chown root:root welcome.txt
> ls -l welcome.txt
> ```

## Using `lsof -i` and `kill -9`

These are important tools for inspecting and managing running processes and open connections on a Linux system.

### `lsof -i`

`lsof` stands for **List Open Files**, and `-i` is used to show files related to **network connections**.

**Use it like this:**

```bash
lsof -i
```

**You can also use:**

```bash
lsof -i :{port}
```
to only show processes using a specific port.


This command shows:

* Which processes are using the network
* The protocol (TCP/UDP)
* The local and remote addresses and ports
* The PID (Process ID) of the program

Example output:

```
COMMAND     PID          USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
java       8424 bob  203u  IPv6 0xf6f39ec321176c54      0t0  TCP *:8585 (LISTEN)
Python     9562 bob    6u  IPv4 0xdf23f16399fa347a      0t0  TCP *:8587 (LISTEN)
Python     9566 bob    6u  IPv4 0xdf23f16399fa347a      0t0  TCP *:8587 (LISTEN)
ruby       9863 bob    9u  IPv4 0x9f18f2240ef5cb69      0t0  TCP localhost:ipsec-msft (LISTEN)
ruby      79529 bob   12u  IPv4 0x92b41537d66ff50d      0t0  TCP localhost:piranha1 (LISTEN)
```

This tells you:

* The command (like `java`, `Python`, `ruby`) that's listening
* The PID of the process
* The port it's listening on (e.g., 8585, 8587, 4500, 4600)

### `kill -9`

Use `kill` to **stop a running process**, and `-9` sends the SIGKILL signal which forcefully ends it.

**Use it like this:**

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

For example:

```bash
kill -9 9562
```

This will terminate the `Python` process with PID 9562 immediately.

> ⚠️ Be cautious using `kill -9`, as it does not let the process clean up before quitting. Only use it if a process won't stop with a regular `kill`.

Together, `lsof -i` and `kill -9` help you:

* Monitor which programs are using network resources
* Terminate any suspicious or misbehaving network process

## Basic Cybersecurity Awareness

Understanding Linux also means being aware of how misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities.

### No SSL (Insecure Web Services)

When web services use HTTP instead of HTTPS, all communication is unencrypted and can be intercepted. Developers should:

* Always use HTTPS in production.
* Install SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt or similar tools.

### Default Credentials

Devices and software often ship with default usernames and passwords such as:

* `admin:admin`
* `root:toor`

Best practice:

* Always change default credentials after setup.
* Disable unused accounts.

### Open Ports

Open ports allow services to communicate over a network. Attackers often scan for open ports to find vulnerabilities.

Check open ports:

```bash
netstat -tuln
ss -tuln
```

Use firewalls (like `ufw`) to limit exposure:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw deny 80
```

### Open or Unrestricted File Permissions

Files with permissions like `777` are a major security risk. They allow anyone to read, write, and execute the file.

### Exposed Personal Data and APIs

Never store API tokens, secrets, or passwords in:

* Public folders (e.g., `/var/www/html`)
* Git repositories
* Files like `config.json` without access control

Use environment variables and secure vaults instead.

## Guided Practice Exercise

Try these steps in your terminal or sandbox environment:

1. Create a directory named `myproject` inside your home folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/myproject
   ```
2. Navigate to that folder and create a file called `notes.txt`:

   ```bash
   cd ~/myproject
   touch notes.txt
   ```
3. Open and edit the file using `nano`, then view it using `cat`.
4. Check its permissions with `ls -l`, and make it read-only for others:

   ```bash
   chmod 744 notes.txt
   ```
5. Check which ports are open on your system:

   ```bash
   ss -tuln
   ```
6. Use `sudo` to list files in `/root` (if allowed):

   ```bash
   sudo ls /root
   ```

## Hands-On Challenge

Now it's time to put your Linux skills to the test! In your repository, you'll find a `linuxcyberA` directory that contains various files and folders for this challenge. Complete the following tasks to find the flags and test your knowledge.

### Challenge Tasks

#### Task 1: Navigation Master
Navigate to the `linuxcyberA` directory and use the `ls` command to list all files and directories. One of the items you see will give you your first flag!

```bash
cd linuxcyberA
ls
```

#### Task 2: File Content Explorer  
Navigate into the `secret` directory within `linuxcyberA` and use the `cat` command to read the contents of `whatisthis.txt`. This file contains your second flag!

```bash
cd secret
cat whatisthis.txt
```

#### Task 3: Permissions Expert
Navigate to the `permissions` directory within `linuxcyberA` and use `cat` to read `file1.txt`. Inside this file, you'll find a question about file permissions. Answer the question and format your response as a flag!

```bash
cd permissions
cat file1.txt
```

The question asks: "What is the file permission which means that anyone can access a file?"
Format your answer as: `flag{your_answer}`

### Challenge Hints

- **Task 1**: Remember that `ls` lists the contents of your current directory
- **Task 2**: Make sure you're in the correct directory before using `cat`
- **Task 3**: Think about the most permissive file permission setting in Linux (hint: it's a 3-digit number)

Good luck with the challenge! This hands-on practice will reinforce your understanding of essential Linux commands and cybersecurity concepts.
