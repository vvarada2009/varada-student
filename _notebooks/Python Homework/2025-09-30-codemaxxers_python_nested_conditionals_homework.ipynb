        "Answers: \n",
        "1) Problem 3 was the most challenging because it had many different conditions that affected each other. I had to carefully think about the order of checksand make sure each possible scenario had a correct outcome. \n",
        "2) I started by grouping the biggest decisions first which was whether the home was occupied or not  since that affected all other choices. Then I nested the time of day inside that, and finally compared the temperature values. \n",
        "3) Yes, an online shopping website’s recommendation system could need more nesting. It might check things like the user’s age, location, previous purchases, time of day, and current sales to decide what products to show. Each of those factors could have multiple sub-conditions that affect the final recommendation."
